# NeuralNetwork
Simple python based Neural Network added. This network contains a single input, output and hidden layers.

## Elements
The project uses python, support for Proessing programming language has also been added.
The initial weights and biases are random (numpy.random.rand).
Uses sigmoid function as activation function.

## Plan
Using Google's quik draw, download doodle data on various obkect and build an app that categorises any new doodle a user creates.

### Future
use as a setup for all future neural network projects.
