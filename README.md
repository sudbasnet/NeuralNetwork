# NeuralNetwork
Simple python based Neural Network added. This network contains a single input, output and hidden layers.

### Elements
The project uses python, support for Processing programming language has also been added.
The initial weights and biases are random (numpy.random.rand).
Uses sigmoid as activation function.

### Plan
Using Google's quik draw, download doodle data on various objects and build an app that categorises any new doodle a user might create. The app will of course be limited to a few categories of doodles.

### Future
use as a setup for all future neural network projects.
